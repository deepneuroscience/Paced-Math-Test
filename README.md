# Paced-Math-Test
Mathematics Test as a mental stress-induction task (in Matlab): DeepBreath - Open source Project for Affective Computing.

* Stress inducers: arithmetic cognitive-load, false sound feedback, time pressure (paced test), (and experimenter's assessment).


#### Runnable: 
Paced-math-test-A.m - Easy (Counting down) /
Paced-math-test-B.m - Difficult (Subtracting a multi-digit number by a multi-digit number repeatedly)

<br></br>

#### Environment: Matlab 2015b
